    <h3>Research Project</h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/index.html">Computational Linguistics</a> group at the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> in the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> is conducting a study to analyze the differences in longitudinal progression of linguistic markers between healthy older adults and ones with dementia. We are interested in assessing the validity and usability of an automated web-based and phone-based system ({{ website_name }}) for linguistic data acquisition, as means for longitudinal monitoring of changes in language ability. To familiarize yourself with the purpose, procedures, and risks of the project, please <a target="_blank" href="/{{ website_id }}/about">click here</a>. When you have carefully read the linked document, you can proceed with the consent form below.</p>

    <p><u>If you have any questions regarding your rights as a research participant, you can contact the Office of Research Ethics (<a href="mailto:ethics.review@utoronto.ca">ethics.review@utoronto.ca</a> or +1 416-946-3273).</u></p>

    <p>The purpose, procedures and risks of the project have been explained to me and I fully understand them. I have been given the chance to ask questions and these were answered to my satisfaction. I understand that I am free to ask questions about the study at any time.</p>

    <p>I understand that I will be asked to complete a demographic questionnaire prior to participation in the study, participate in one or more sessions consisting of questions testing cognitive ability, and complete an optional post-study usability questionnaire. The data collected as part of this study will be used for research purposes only, and will be retained for an indefinite length of time to facilitate future research.</p>

    <p>I understand that my participation is voluntary and that I may withdraw from the study at any time, either by contacting the investigators directly or through the website. I understand that all personal information and data recorded up to that point will be destroyed immediately. I also understand that in no way my acceptance to participate or my withdrawal from participation will affect my interests in any way.</p>
