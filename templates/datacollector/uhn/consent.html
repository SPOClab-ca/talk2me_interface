<p>
    Before proceeding, you (or an alternate decision make) must read the UHN consent form, and provide informed consent by signing it. A paper copy of the UHN consent form will have been provided to you by the student investigator. Take as much time as you need to review the UHN consent form and decide whether you want to participate. 
</p>

<p>
    After completing the consent form, you may bring it in person to the student investigator. You will then complete a short survey collecting demographic information and will complete a first session under the supervision of the student investigator. In total, you will complete seven sessions with Talk2Me over six months. Each session will take less than 15 minutes. You will complete four of the sessions at home, using the website by yourself, or with the help of a caregiver. The remaining sessions will be completed at the clinic in the presence of a researcher.
</p>

<p>
    We may email or call you after a month has passed between sessions, to remind you to perform a session. At the end of the study, you will complete a survey, asking you questions about the website and your opinion of it. The survey will be completed in person at the clinic, and will take approximately 10 minutes.

<h3>Research Project</h3>
<p>
    The <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/index.html">Computational Linguistics</a> group at the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> in the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> and the <a href="http://www.uhn.ca/TorontoRehab">Toronto Rehabilitation Institute</a> of the <a href="http://www.uhn.ca/">University Health Network</a> are conducting a study to analyze the differences in longitudinal progression of linguistic markers between healthy older adults and ones with dementia. We are interested in assessing the validity and usability of an automated web- and phone-based system ({{ website_name }}) for linguistic data acquisition, as means for longitudinal monitoring of changes in language ability.
